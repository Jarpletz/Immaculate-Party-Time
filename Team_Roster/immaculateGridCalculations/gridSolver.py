# Solves the "immaculate grid" by processing queries for players matching specific criteria.
# Parameters:
# - questions (list[str]): A list of questions for the grid.

# Process:
# - Column Queries: Answers related to the top of the grid (first three questions).
# - Row Queries: Answers related to the side of the grid (last three questions).
# - Matching players are determined by finding intersections between column and row query results.
# Notes:
# - Players are added to the final result only once, avoiding duplicates using the `seenPlayers` set.
# Debug:
# - Outputs the team list, questions received, and debug details for each matching player.
# Returns: A list of full names for players who satisfy the grid criteria.
